useCallback: is a react hook that returns a memorized version of a callback function

1.) It ensures that the function does not get re-created on every render unless its dependencies change
2.) This is very useful when 
a.)passing a function as a prop to a child component(to avoid unnecessary re-renders)
b.)using function inside useEffect/useMemo dependencies
c.)optimizing performance in large apps

Syntax :

const memorizedCallback =useCallback(
    ()=>{
        ///function logic
    },
    [dependencies]
);

How it works:

1.)When a component is rendered, useCallback checks the dependency aaray
2.)If the dependencies haven't changed , it returns the cached function 
3.)if the dependencies have changed, it recreates the function and caches the new version
